Description:
    This project was made to allow users to find recipes based on the contents of their fridge or pantry.  When adding items to their fridge, they are assisted by Nutritionix's API which helps autocorrect food items when being added.  
    After selecting their food items the user can search for recipes, via Edamam's API, that have those ingredients.  OpenFridge then gives links to the website where the recipe resides.

Motivation:
    We wanted to experiment andlearn new technologies like Firebase, New APIs and Auto-Complete functions.  This was a great platform to view these proccesses working together to make a viable product, and a website I would expect to see

Team Efforts
    The team was divided into three different focuses
    Blake worked on getting Firebase Authentication and the user's personal server storage 

    Jason worked on getting Edamam and Nutritionix APIs working and applying them to the front end.

    Mark worked on the overall design and look of the page, and implementing the technologies to fit the site and work together.

Future of this project:
    Things we would like to implement in the future:
        -Shopping list implementation.  An option to correlate current ingredients and additional ingredients according to the info retrieved from Edamam's API service.

        -Favorite's section.  A part of the server storage that stores the user's selected favorites and displays them on another tab.

        -Inventory options.  We would like to explore the idea where a user could use this website like a "kitchen inventory" system.  The user could use this site as a method to remember what contents are at home, and to generate a shopping list based on specific recipes he/she selected.
